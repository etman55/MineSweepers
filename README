#MineSweepers Robot.

To do such a robot you will need basic items such as:

4 DC motors for moving the robot 

Motor Drivers relays will be fine  

1 Arduino Mega

1 metal detector sensor

1 Ultra sonic sensor 

1 digital Compass "HMC5883L"

1 rotary encoder 

1 additional wheel for the rotary encoder to be installed with it

1 Bluetooth module "HC-05"

then you need to install these items all together.


NOTE: you need to put all these files in one directory 
the main file in "minesweepers.ino"
